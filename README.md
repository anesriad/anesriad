#  Hey I'm Anas Riad
### I am a computer scientist with a keen interest in data science (machine learning) and cloud computing (AWS)
#### I'm certified twice with AWS as a cloud practitioner and solutions architect associate
#### I have a master's degree in automation and IT engineering and currently finalizing my second master's in advanced computer science in August 2023

## About me:
Iâ€™ve co-founded a musical event company when I was 19, and been touring as a DJ all over Morocco for 5 years and I also played in France. These experiences taught me the importance of taking action, facing difficulties, embracing failures, and so many other things Iâ€™m grateful for today.
Iâ€™m a big fan and practitioner of productivity and love reading books. Since, 2020 my whole life was centered around personal development and improving performance via productivity, healthy lifestyle, and growth mindset.
Iâ€™ve been through a yearly coaching program where I got to improve my habits, routines, health, and relationship with my body and mind. Iâ€™m now certified as a life coach from Heroic coaching program based in the USA.
I believe that a healthy mind is directly linked to a healthy body and vice versa, thatâ€™s why I prioritize taking care of myself via meditation, healthy foods, exercising (tennis, football, and gym), and also enjoying life (family, friends, trips...).
I am a person who likes positive pressure since it gives the best output in my work. Iâ€™ve been branding on healthy lifestyle and productivity on LinkedIn and Twitter for 14 months, I was creating content on a daily basis without skipping one day. I was creating text, video, and designs to educate my audience in topics such as productivity, lifestyle, and mindset. I got over 4000 followers in combined accounts.
