→ Analysed the software market for a SaaS company wanting to penetrate the market effectively. This project helped identify where to invest more in marketing and advertisement. The main tools used are Excel, Python, and Notion. Client based in the USA. <br>
→ 8-figure ads and marketing campaigns analysed over 10 different marketing (and social) channels for a US-based e-commerce giant where I helped identify where to spend more and the right timing (seasonality etc...). I worked under an experienced data strategist who was leading the project and I was assigned data-related analysis, machine learning, and reporting. <br>
→ Led the data science team in Kadogoodiz London where I built a recommender system to recommend what products to buy and at what price to make the best revenue margin. <br>
